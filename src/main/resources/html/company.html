Ideabank was initially founded in 2006 by Sean Kim.<BR>
While it was a successful operation, Sean decided to pursue a career in financial engineering and eventually data engineering and the company was dormant for 15 years.<BR>
In 2021, Sean realized there are many gaps in the software engineering where the right productivity softwares can help so re-opened the site to bring
much value to the engineering community.<BR><BR>
